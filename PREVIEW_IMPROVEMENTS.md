# Camera Preview Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Aspect Ratio Problems**
- **Problem**: Preview was stretched or distorted due to incorrect aspect ratio handling
- **Solution**: Added proper aspect ratio calculation and TextureView transform configuration
- **Implementation**: `getOptimalPreviewSize()` function now selects camera preview sizes that match common aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3)

### 2. **Preview Sizing Issues**
- **Problem**: Camera preview looked "fluent" (pixelated/low quality) due to incorrect size selection
- **Solution**: Enhanced size selection algorithm with better filtering
- **Implementation**: 
  - Filter out excessively large preview sizes (max 1920x1080)
  - Prioritize common aspect ratios
  - Select highest quality size within reasonable limits

### 3. **Transform Matrix Corrections**
- **Problem**: Incorrect matrix transformations causing distorted preview
- **Solution**: Simplified and corrected matrix calculations
- **Implementation**: Use proper scaling that maintains aspect ratio and centers the preview

## Key Improvements

### Enhanced Size Selection
```kotlin
fun getOptimalPreviewSize(sizes: Array<Size>, viewWidth: Int, viewHeight: Int): Size {
    // Filter reasonable sizes (â‰¤ 1920x1080)
    // Match aspect ratios with tolerance
    // Fallback to common ratios (16:9, 4:3)
    // Select highest quality within constraints
}
```

### Proper Transform Configuration
```kotlin
fun configureTransform(textureView: TextureView, previewSize: Size, context: Context) {
    // Calculate scale to fit while maintaining aspect ratio
    // Center the preview in the view
    // Apply clean matrix transformation
}
```

### Better Camera Setup
- Added auto-focus (`CONTROL_AF_MODE_CONTINUOUS_PICTURE`)
- Added auto-exposure (`CONTROL_AE_MODE_ON`)
- Improved error handling with try-catch blocks
- Better handling of view dimension availability

### Timing Improvements
- Added `post{}` calls to ensure view dimensions are available
- Handle size changes in `onSurfaceTextureSizeChanged`
- Graceful fallback when view dimensions aren't ready

## Expected Results

1. **Sharp Preview**: Proper size selection eliminates pixelation
2. **Correct Aspect Ratio**: No stretching or distortion
3. **Centered Preview**: Preview properly centered in view
4. **Better Auto-Focus**: Continuous autofocus for better image quality
5. **Stable Performance**: Improved error handling prevents crashes

## Technical Details

- **Preview Size Limits**: Max 1920x1080 to prevent memory issues
- **Aspect Ratio Tolerance**: 0.15 for better size matching
- **Transform Method**: Uses `Math.min()` scaling to fit without cropping
- **Fallback Strategy**: Common aspect ratios when exact match unavailable

The preview should now look much more natural with proper proportions and good image quality!
